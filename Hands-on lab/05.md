## Exercise 5: Trigger a build and release

Duration: 10 Minutes

In this exercise, you will trigger an automated build and release of the web application using the build and release pipelines you created in earlier exercises. The release pipeline will deploy to three stages: dev, test, and production.

Any commit of new or modified code to the master branch will automatically trigger a build. The steps below are useful when you want to manually trigger a build without a code change.

### Task 1: Manually queue a new build and follow it through the release pipeline

1. Select the *Pipelines* menu item from the left-hand navigation. 

2. In the *Pipelines* view, choose the *TailspinToys* pipeline recently created.

3. In the *TailspinToys* pipeline runs page, choose the *Run pipeline* button in the upper right section of the page.

4. This will present a modal window titled *Run pipeline*. Choose the **Run** button at the bottom of the modal window.

5. The screen will refresh and begin to show details about the build process.

6. Once the build completes, it will resemble the snippet below.

7. Because we configured continuous deployment, the deployment to the dev stage will automatically be triggered. It will continue through on to the test and production stages. A successful release through all three stages will look like the screen shot below.
